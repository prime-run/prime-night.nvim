## üé® Customization

You can easily override any highlight group to tailor the theme to your liking. Place the following code *after* setting the colorscheme.

```lua
-- Example: Make comments italic and change their color
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "Comment", { fg = "#7A88A9", italic = true })

-- Example: Remove the background from Telescope's selection
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "TelescopeSelection", { bg = "none" })
```

### Vim (`init.vim`)

Use the `highlight` command to override a highlight group.

```vim
" Example: Make comments italic and change their color
highlight Comment guifg=#7A88A9 gui=italic

" Example: Remove the background from Telescope's selection
highlight TelescopeSelection guibg=none
```
